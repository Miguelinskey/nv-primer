# Nuvocargo Primer

This repository contains a custom build of Primer CSS, tailored for Nuvocargo with our own nuvocargo-light theme and color-modes structure & variables. It's designed to stay in sync with upstream Primer while allowing for requirements.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install   # Install dependencies
npm start     # Start the development server with live reloading
```

## Customizations

- Custom Themes: Incorporates nuvocargo-light.css for a branded look and feel.
- Variable Adjustments: Our own variable set is included for consistent theming.
- Reduced Complexity: Marketing components have been removed for simplicity.

## Documentation

We've enhanced the documentation to be more comprehensive and user-friendly than the official Primer documentation. The npm start command sets up a development environment that watches for changes in the src folder.
